## Additional Considerations

- Documentation: Ensure each project has thorough documentation, including setup instructions, usage examples, and API references. This demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail.
- Testing: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to showcase your commitment to quality and reliability.
- CI/CD: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.
- Code Quality: Use linters, formatters, and follow best practices to maintain high code quality.
- Architecture Diagrams: Include architecture diagrams for complex projects to illustrate your design thinking and system understanding.
- ReadMe Files: Write detailed README files for each project, explaining the purpose, features, and how to run the project locally.
